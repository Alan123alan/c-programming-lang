#### Circular Buffer

A circular buffer works with two pointers to access the elements in the buffer, both move incrementaly  
and ciclically, this means that after the pointer that's pointing to the last element in the circular  
buffer is incremented it will now point to the first element in the buffer.

When the buffer is created both pointers point at the firs element in the buffer.
